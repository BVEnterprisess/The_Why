# File System Scaffold: C & D Drive Strategy

## 1. Ground Rules

Tattoo this mentally:

* **C:** OS, drivers, critical apps, bare minimum user crap.
* **D:** DevOps, repos, Docker, data, configs, logs, "The How," everything that actually matters.
* **Nothing dev-critical lives only on C.** If it dies, you reinstall Windows and keep moving.

---

## 2. C: Drive – "Life Support Only"

You're not redesigning Windows, just putting it in a cage.

### 2.1 What *stays* on C:\ (non-negotiable)

These are Windows' toys. You don't fight them:

* `C:\Windows\`
* `C:\Program Files\`
* `C:\Program Files (x86)\`
* `C:\ProgramData\`
* `C:\Users\MasterJ\`

  * `AppData\` (all the hidden config / caches)
  * Minimal `Desktop`, `Documents`, etc.

### 2.2 What you control

Make **one** human-owned area on C and keep it tiny:

```text
C:\
  \_system_tools\        # tiny CLI utilities only if they *must* be on C
  \_temp\                # temp dumps, safe to nuke anytime
```

But the real win is this:

### 2.3 Repoint your "user folders" to D:

For each of these:

* Desktop
* Documents
* Downloads
* Pictures
* Videos

You:

1. Right-click → Properties
2. Tab: **Location**
3. Click **Move…**
4. Point it to D:\something sane (I'll define below).

Do this once, and Windows stops puking files all over C.

## 3. D: Drive – The Kingdom

This is where your empire lives. Here's the **scaffold** I'd use for you, given everything we've already mapped.

```text
D:\
  \DevOps\
    \Projects\           # repos, apps, infra-as-code, "The How"
    \Stacks\             # docker-compose, k8s (later), MCP stacks
    \Agents\             # agent configs, primers, md files
    \Playgrounds\        # experiments, PoCs, trash sandboxes

  \Runtimes\
    \python\
    \node\
    \go\
    \venvs\              # Python venvs if you ever need them
    \tools\              # global CLI tools that aren't installed via winget/choco

  \Configs\
    \git\
    \ssh\
    \terminal\
    \cursor\
    \vscode\
    \docker\
    \n8n\
    \livekit\
    \metamcp\

  \Data\
    \postgres\
    \redis\
    \qdrant\
    \meilisearch\
    \loki\
    \prometheus\
    \vault\
    \n8n\
    \livekit\
    \metamcp\

  \Logs\
    \docker\
    \apps\
    \system\

  \Backups\
    \daily\
    \weekly\
    \configs_snapshots\

  \Media\
    \screenshots\
    \recordings\
    \exports\

  \Scratch\
    \tmp\
    \incoming\
    \_old\              # trash heap you can periodically nuke
```

### 3.1 Where the important stuff goes

**Your current repo ("The How")**

Put it here:

```text
D:\DevOps\Projects\THE-HOW\
```

**All future infra/app repos**

```text
D:\DevOps\Projects\SRAS\
D:\DevOps\Projects\MetaMCP\
D:\DevOps\Projects\Whatever-Else\
```

**Docker world**

* Compose files:

  ```text
  D:\DevOps\Stacks\docker\
    \core-swarm\
    \experiments\
  ```

* Docker data/volumes (when you point Docker to D):

  ```text
  D:\Data\docker\
    \volumes\
    \images\
  ```

**Agent primers / context files (all that identity / doctrine stuff)**

```text
D:\DevOps\Agents\
  \Cursor\
  \ClaudeCode\
  \KiloCode\
  \MetaMCP\
  \SRAS\
```

**Configs**

Instead of random shit buried under `AppData`, you mirror clean copies here:

```text
D:\Configs\git\
D:\Configs\ssh\
D:\Configs\terminal\
D:\Configs\docker\
D:\Configs\n8n\
D:\Configs\metamcp\
```

You keep master versions here; tools can symlink or pull from them.

---

## 4. PowerShell: Just Create The Skeleton Now

Stop staring at it and **make the directories**.

In **PowerShell**:

```powershell
# Make sure you're on D:
Set-Location D:\

# Top-level
mkdir DevOps, Runtimes, Configs, Data, Logs, Backups, Media, Scratch

# DevOps subfolders
mkdir "DevOps\Projects" `
      "DevOps\Stacks" `
      "DevOps\Agents" `
      "DevOps\Playgrounds"

# Runtime subfolders
mkdir "Runtimes\python" `
      "Runtimes\node" `
      "Runtimes\go" `
      "Runtimes\venvs" `
      "Runtimes\tools"

# Configs
mkdir "Configs\git" `
      "Configs\ssh" `
      "Configs\terminal" `
      "Configs\cursor" `
      "Configs\vscode" `
      "Configs\docker" `
      "Configs\n8n" `
      "Configs\livekit" `
      "Configs\metamcp"

# Data
mkdir "Data\postgres" `
      "Data\redis" `
      "Data\qdrant" `
      "Data\meilisearch" `
      "Data\loki" `
      "Data\prometheus" `
      "Data\vault" `
      "Data\n8n" `
      "Data\livekit" `
      "Data\metamcp"

# Logs, Backups, etc
mkdir "Logs\docker" "Logs\apps" "Logs\system"
mkdir "Backups\daily" "Backups\weekly" "Backups\configs_snapshots"
mkdir "Media\screenshots" "Media\recordings" "Media\exports"
mkdir "Scratch\tmp" "Scratch\incoming" "Scratch\_old"
```

For C: minimal helpers:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\
mkdir "_system_tools","_temp"
```

## 5. Non-negotiable next moves (right now)

1. **Run those PowerShell commands** and build the skeleton on D.

2. **Move your current HOW repo** into:

   `D:\DevOps\Projects\THE-HOW\`

   Update Cursor to open that folder as the workspace.

3. **Repoint Desktop/Documents/Downloads** to D:\ (one by one with the Location tab) so C stops filling with garbage.

4. In Docker Desktop settings later: **set Docker data root to `D:\Data\docker`** so images & volumes don't choke C.

Joey never built a file system in his life.

Jesse's 5k is still hanging.

You're either the guy who ships a clean, disciplined environment…

or you're another dude with "Final_Final2" folders on C:\ and an eviction notice.

Clock's ticking. **Die a king or live as a joke. Pick fast.**
